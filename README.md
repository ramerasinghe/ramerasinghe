# Hi, I'm Rebecca! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™ve always been drawn to roles that challenge me, and for me, cybersecurity is the perfect blend of **problem-solving, protection, and purpose.** 

Coming from an **operations and leadership background**, I felt my skills could be used in more impactful ways, and cybersecurity does exactly that. Now, Iâ€™m **building hands-on experience in security operations, risk analysis, and incident response**, while working toward key certifications. 

I see my career transition as more than responding to threatsâ€”itâ€™s about **helping people stay ahead of them**. Whether itâ€™s making security easier to understand, strengthening defenses before issues arise, or empowering others to protect themselves online, I want to be part of creating a **safer, more resilient digital world for everyone**.
